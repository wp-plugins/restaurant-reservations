This plugin is part of a group of plugins for restaurants.

= How to use =

There is a short guide to using the plugin in the /docs/ folder. It can be accessed by following the Help link listed under the plugin on the Plugins page in your WordPress admin area. Not sure where that is? The last [screenshot](http://wordpress.org/plugins/restaurant-reservations/screenshots/) for this plugin will show you where to find it.

= Developers =

This plugin is packed with hooks so you can extend it, customize it and rebrand it as needed. Development takes place on [GitHub](https://github.com/NateWr/restaurant-reservations), so fork it up.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `restaurant-reservations.zip`
2. Upload the contents of `restaurant-reservations.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to Bookings > Settings to set up the page to display your booking form.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a shortcode to print the booking form? =

Yes, use the `[booking-form]` shortcode.

= Can I change the format of the date or time? =

Yes, set the format for the datepicker in *Bookings > Settings*. The format used in the backend will depend on the date and time formats in your WordPress settings.

= The datepicker or timepicker is not working. =

If you load up the form and no date or time picker is popping up when you select those fields, this is likely caused by a Javascript error from another plugin or theme. You can find the problematic plugin by deactivating other plugins you're using one-by-one. Test after each deactivation to see if the date and time pickers work.

If you have deactivated all other plugins and still have a problem, try switching to a default theme (one of the TwentySomething themes).

= I'm not receiving notification emails for new bookings. =

This is almost always the result of issues with your server and can be caused by a number of things. Before posting a support request, please run through the following checklist:

1. Double-check that the notification email in *Bookings > Settings > Notifications* is correct.
2. Make sure that WordPress is able to send emails. The admin email address in the WordPress settings page should receive notifications of new users.
3. If you're not able to receive regular WordPress emails, contact your web host and ask them for help sorting it out.
4. If you're able to receive regular WordPress emails but not booking notifications, check your spam filters or junk mail folders.
5. If you still haven't found the emails, contact your web host and let them know the date, time and email address where you expected to receive a booking. They should be able to check their logs to see what is happening to the email.

= Can I make the phone number required? =

This is a common request so I have written a small addon to do this for you. [Learn more](http://themeofthecrop.com/2015/01/08/simple-phone-validation-restaurant-reservations/).

= Can I translate the booking form? =

Yes, everything in this plugin can be translated using the standard translation process and software like PoEdit. If you're not familiar with that process, I'd recommend you take a look at the [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/) plugin, which provides a simple interface in your WordPress admin area for translating themes and plugins.

If you make a translation, please help others out by adding it to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/NateWr/restaurant-reservations) so that I can distribute it for others.

= I want to add a field to the form. Can I do that? =

I'm working on an addon that will allow you to customize the booking form and add fields through your WordPress admin panel. Until that's ready, the only way to accomplish this is by using the built-in hooks. Developers who are comfortable writing plugins for WordPress can find a rough guide in the answer to [this support request](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/edit-form-label-and-add-input-fields).

This update fixes a non-critical issue with the display of the loading spinner in the upcoming 4.2 version of WordPress.

= 1.4.4 =

This update also improves the German translation and adds a Hebrew translation. Read the full changelog for details.

= 1.3 =

= 1.1.3 =

= 1.1.1 =
This update fixes problems some users reported when using the Firefox browser to modify the booking schedule. This required an update to a library that is shared with another plugin, Food and Drink Menu. If you are using that plugin, please update that one as well or you may get some odd behavior. (Thanks to sangwh and bforsoft for reporting the issue.)

= 1.1 =
This update improves internationalization (i8n) by attempting to determine the appropriate language for the booking form datepicker from your WordPress settings. It also adds a setting to pick a language manually from a list of supported languages. This update also adds options to block late bookings at least 4 hours or 1 day in advance. Thanks to Remco and Roland for their early feedback.

= 1.0.2 =
